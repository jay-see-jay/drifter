# DRFTR

Get an email > have AI draft a response > see draft in your Gmail inbox.

Drafts are written in your tone of voice, and have the context of all your previous emails, so you should find yourself
having to spend a lot less time in your inbox.

To try the private-alpha, [send me an email](mailto:hey@jayseejay.com).
